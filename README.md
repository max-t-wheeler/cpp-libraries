# cpp-libraries

A collection of algorithms I wrote in 2016-2017. 

These libraries rely on the linear algebra library Armadillo, and come with visualization tools such as Gnuplot and OpenGL.

- The abstract algebra algorithms are taken from E. M. Hall's An Introduction to Abstract Algebra (1966)

- The graph theory algorithms are taken from Douglas West's Introduction to Graph Theory (2001). I would have continued but after discovering NetworkX I decided to migrate to Python.

- The numerical computing algorithms are taken from lecture notes on numerical computing provided by Mark Holmes at RPI (2014).

All other algorithms have been cited appropriately.
